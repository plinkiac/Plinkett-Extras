PLINKETT:
Hey, everyone. It's me, Mr. Plinkett. And I'm here to tell you that Red Letter Media has got something new for you. It's a Patreon account! Or page. Something like that. "What is a Patreon?" you ask. I don't know. Somebody tell me. Hello?

LAWYER:
[unintelligible]

PLINKETT:
Uh-huh. Oh. Oh, r-, oh really? You've got to be kidding me. So on this Patreon, you can choose tiers to donate to help Red Letter Media make their stuff. You know, make it better, make it faster. Especially my reviews! I'm working on one right now! And it's taking forever! A $2.00 a month pledge will get you access to private posts by the Red Letter Media gang, including updates on what they're working on, comments on current movies, and whatever else they feel like posting. $5.00 will get to whatever $2.00 gets you plus behind-the-scenes photos and graphics and stuff like that. And for $15.00 a month you get exclusive never-before-seen video content! Behind the scenes, leftovers, outtakes, weird stuff like that!

JAY:
Mr. Plinkett smells like a soiled mattress that's been soiled on by another mattress.

PLINKETT:
It's like a subscription that's voluntary. You know, to keep those Red Letter Media clowns doing what they're doing, only faster and more intense. You don't have to do it. Do whatever you want. I don't care. Oh, my god. I have to go now. My cat's trying to take a dump in my pasta fazool!

PLINKETT:
What?
Oh, no!
They buried me alive!
Shit, I ain't dead yet.
Help me!
I'm trapped in a coffin like Whitney Houston.
What the fuck?
They buried me with DVD's.
Dog Gone?
Why would they bury me with these movies?
They must not want me to review them.
The Matrix Reloaded?
It happened again?
What's this?
Karate Dog with Simon Rex and Jaime Pressly and Jon Voight.
And featuring the voice...Spider-Man 3?
Why are all these DVD's inside of my coffin?
What the fuck is this?
Oh, what else do we got?
What's this?
Oh, no.
Oh, The Room?
Autographed personally by Tommy Wiseau.
That's a pretty good movie, though.
Quigley?
Oh, no.
Why is this in here?
I ain't gonna watch this shit.
Fuck you!
Star Trek V?
This is on VHS.
I ain't got a VCR in my coffin.
Just a DVD player.
Now I gotta sit all alone with these bad movies all over my body for eternity.
Shit.
Ow, fuck.
They're all over me!
Ow, my god!
Oh, fuck this!
I gotta get out of this goddamn coffin!
I gotta get out of this goddamn coffin!
Okay.
Yeah, this is good.
I saw this once in a movie.
It was called Cars 2.

PALPATINE:
Good!

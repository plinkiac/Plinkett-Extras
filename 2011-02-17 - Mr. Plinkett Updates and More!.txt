PLINKETT:
Hey, everybody.
I'm selling out!
In fact, I'm selling out while I'm jumping the shark.
Check out my webzone for a link to The Great Plinkett Auction on ebay.
You can bid on all of my personal treasured items like:
My Titanic popcorn tub.
My goddamn phone.
My stupid grandkids's Star Wars toys.
And some of the actual scripts that I used to make my reveiws from.
Even props from the fucking flop movie Feeding Frenzy.
Why am I selling all my shit?
Well, I just got back from my doctor.
He said normally they can operate on a brain tumor, but this one is malignant.
So I've only got a little...

LAWYER:
Mr. Plinkett?

PLINKETT:
What?

LAWYER:
It's Saul, your lawyer.

PLINKETT:
Oh, uh-huh..

LAWYER:
Listen, we need to discuss a better way to talk about the situation.

PLINKETT:
Sorry, that was my lawyer.
here's no problem at all.
Please continue to buy my products and visit my webzone.
Speaking of webzones and products, there's a new Plinkett e-store, with lots of new merchandise, like my new Jump the Shark t-shirt.
We've got mugs, baby bibs, t-shirts, hats, and so much more!
Act now!
Operators are standing by.

PALPATINE:
Would you quit selling out?
You make me sick!

PLINKETT:
Hey, don't tell me not to sell out!
Look at you, with all that bling on, you fucking old leathery-skinned asshole!

PALPATINE:
You sold out more than George Lucas did!
You shark-jumping sellout!

PLINKETT:
Hey, shouldn't you be dead by now?
You're so old!

PALPATINE:
What do you mean, I'm old?
We're the same age!
We went to the same high school!

PLINKETT:
Anyway, I mean, at some point, you will just die of natural causes, right?
I'm getting a tired of you constantly interrupting me.
Oh.
Um...

PALPATINE:
Where is the Episode III...

PLINKETT:
It's right here.
It's on my webzone right now, redlettmedia.com.

PALPATINE:
Good.
I will watch it soon.
But now, where is the Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull...

PLINKETT:
It's right here.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
It's on my webzone right now, at redlettmedia.com.

PALPATINE:
What about The Last...

PLINKETT:
That's done, too.
It's right here.
It's on my webzone right now.

PALPATINE:
Bullshit.
You did not make all those reviews already.

PLINKETT:
Why don't you go there and find out, asshole.

PALPATINE:
Where is...

PLINKETT:
Right here.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
It's on my webzone right now, at redlettmedia.com.

PALPATINE:
I was not going to ask for a review on that.

PLINKETT:
I've foreseen it, though.

PALPATINE:
Only I can do that.

PLINKETT:
Look, would you just go away already?

PALPATINE:
I have prepared a 108-page response to your so-called Phantom Menace review.

PLINKETT:
Wait...what?

PALPATINE:
I shall now read it aloud.
Chapter 1, paragraph 1.
If you didn't like the Star Wars prequels, then you're stupid pants.

PLINKETT:
Please, stop.

PALPATINE:
You simply just don't understand the complexity of what happened in the films.

PLINKETT:
What?

PALPATINE:
I will refrain from explaining the complexity, because it is so complex and technical, that you do not need to understand it to enjoy the film.

PLINKETT:
Oh, god.
Stop it.

PALPATINE:
It is like a very deep game of chess, where both players don't know how to play chess.

PLINKETT:
You just don't get it, do you?

PALPATINE:
No, I'm afraid it is you who don't get it.
Your opinion is wrong, and mine is right!

PLINKETT:
Please, just let it end.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
Why, hello. Its me, Mr. Plinkett. I'd like to talk very briefly about Disney's Marvel's Star Wars: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story by Disney...conglomerate corporation. There's been a lot of discussion on this movie recently. Some say it's the worst thing since the prequels, while others say it's the best Star Wars movie ever because it's got the best action and the most explosions. Here's the thing about opinions: they're all wrong unless they're mine. On that note, let's discuss, shall we? In filmmaking, there's a concept called The Triangle of Truth. This idea includes three things: fast, cheap, and good. The idea goes that you can't have all three. You can make it fast and cheap, but it's not gonna be good. And you can make it good and fast, but it's not gonna be cheap and so on. You get the idea...I hope. I'm gonna apply a similar concept to a Star Wars movie. Except my triangle will include these items: characters, story, and emotion. These are more checkmarks rather than a triangular formula, but just stick with me for a minute. I'll explain it. And as you'll soon see, certain films can include all three. The original Star Wars trilogy succeeded so well because they hit all the marks. Humor and action is essentially this. You can just eat the icing on the cake, which is tasty, but you'll get real fat! You'll get cavities and your teeth will rot out. And after eating too much, you'll start to get sick of it. You need a nice soft cake to balance it all out...just like the Force!

CHIRRUT IMWE:
...all is as the Force wills it.

PLINKETT:
Remember the Force? Let's take a look at the Force Awakens. Now it two out of three marks, which made it passable. Our characters have some likable qualities.

REY SKYALKER:
You got him with one blast!

FINN:
You set me up for it!

REY SKYWALKER:
It was perfect!

FINN:
That was pretty good.

PLINKETT:
Moments that made them feel like real people, which helped us connect. We rooted for them, we felt for them, and we suffered with them.

REY SKYWALKER:
No!

PLINKETT:
Thus, we had an emotional connection when shit hit the fan. If The Force Awakens didn't retread A New Hope's plot, it'd get a big checkmark right here. But it did. And I don't think I need to go into this any further. Now let's look at Rogue One.

JYN ERSO:
Let's just get this over with, shall we?

PLINKETT:
It got no checkmarks from me! Yes, Rogue One had humor...

K2SO:
There's a 26% chance of failure.

CASSIAN ANDOR:
How much farther?

BODHI ROOK:
I don't know. I'm not sure, I never really come this way, but we're close, we're close. I know that.

K2SO:
Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure.

BODHI ROOK:
I don't want to know, thank you.

K2SO:
I understand.

PLINKETT:
...and some of the best most awesomest Star Wars explosions ever. But it received no checkmarks from me for obvious reasons.

JYN ERSO:
what chance do we have? What chance do we have? The question is 'What choice?' Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission.

PLINKETT:
Now let's compare two scenes. Are you ready? This is a scene from Rogue One. Cassian and Jyn Erso have a shootout with stormtroopers in some kind of city. Pretty great, huh? Pretty exciting. Now here's a similar scene from A New Hope.

HAN SOLO:
Get behind me! Get behind me!

PLINKETT:
There's one difference between these two scenes: one contains characters we actually like.

HAN SOLO:
Can't get out that way.

PRINCESS LEIA:
Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.

HAN SOLO:
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness?

PLINKETT:
You hear them saying things to each other. We understand their perspectives. It's like we know them.

HAN SOLO:
I can't hold them off forever! Now what?

PRINCESS LEIA:
This is some rescue! You came in here, and you didn't have a plan for getting out?

HAN SOLO:
He's the brains, sweetheart!

PLINKETT:
We liked them. Now here's my re-edit when you have a movie written with unlikable characters...who have nothing to say. Without characters we like, it's really just people fighting with stormtroopers. And finally, context. Without the Star Wars IP and familiar things, imagine Rogue One as a movie called People Trying to Get Plans for a Super Weapon. These characters would just be genetic science fiction characters. This guy would be talking about some kind of mystical thing we never get to see, and we're just told what it is. Sort of.

JYN ERSO:
May the Force be with us.

LUKE SKYWALKER:
The Force?

PLINKETT:
And these things would probably just look like this: genetic science fiction machines or robots or, or weapons. We'd ask ourselves "Who's in charge? Who's our main bad guy? Is it that guy? Is it this other guy? Is that that weird guy in a Halloween costume? Why are these two guys mucking up the story? Or how'd the heck did that one guy in the giant plastic helmet choke that other guy like that? Nobody told me!"

OBI-WAN KENOBI:
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.

PLINKETT:
Then finally, without context, the whole movie is basically that these guys have a thing that could do this. These people aren't gonna try and stop the thing. They're just gonna get the plans to do it later? After the movie is over? At the end of the film we'd ask ourselves "Oh. Well, they didn't stop that thing? And everyone died? This doesn't feel like an ending." Also, we'd ask ourselves why the dad didn't just tell Jyn, his daughter, that all they needed to do was shoot a proton torpedo in the exhaust port. You know, the one at the end of the trench? Do we really need to steal the complicated plans just to tell somebody that? In the end, without relying heavily on context, you just have a sci-fi movie without a satisfying ending, with confusing motivations, uninteresting characters, and no emotional investment. My point is, just go ahead and eat all that icing. Don't worry. You won't get diabetes. Just try not to get too much of it in your beards.

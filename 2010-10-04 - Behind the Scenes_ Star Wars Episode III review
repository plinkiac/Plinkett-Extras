JACK:
Okay.
So what are we doing here?
We got a jib?

MIKE:
Yes.

JACK:
Okay.

MIKE:
And let's test it out.

JACK:
Okay.
Testing out the jib.

JAY:
Maybe turn it on here.

MIKE:
This tends to lean a bit.

JAY:
Oh, right.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You just want me hit record?

MIKE:
No, no, no.
Just turn it on.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's a little bit, it's straight.

JACK:
There's the shot.

MIKE:
Somewhere around there?

JAY:
That looks good.

JACK:
Tell me, tell me about what we're, what we're gonna shoot here right now.

JOCELYN:
Uh, we're doing a teaser trailer-type thing.
Isn't that right?

JAY:
Yes.

JOCELYN:
Uh, for Revenge of the Sith review.

JACK:
Ah.

JOCELYN:
With Mr. Plinkett.

JACK:
Do you, how often do you get stopped on the street, uh, for, for, being, uh, the, the hooker in the Plinkett reviews?

JOCELYN:
You know what?
I don't ever.
But it was kind of funny because when I was buying this costume...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

JOCELYN:
I was getting, like, the little, uh, body suit thing. It's a, it's a one-piece, you know?

JACK:
Okay.

JOCELYN:
And, um, it was at Halloween Express...

JACK:
Oh.

JOCELYN:
In Greendale.

JACK:
Oh.

JOCELYN:
And the nice thing about it is the lady, she had really, cute young girl with, like, red hair, and she's, like,
"Can I show you around?"
Because it was, like, this huge warehouse of tons of wigs and anything you could ever want for Halloweeen.
And I was like,
"Yeah, I just need a body suit."
So she took me around and showed me a whole bunch of stuff.
I tried on the stuff.
She's like,
"Yeah, that works for you."
"It looks good."
And then, she's like,
"What is, are you doing a film tomorrow?"
"What is that for?"
And I was like,
"Well, have you ever seen, you know, the Star Wars videos on YouTube, the review?"
And she's like,
"Yeah!"
And I'm like,
"I'm the girl in the basement."
And she's like,
"Shut the fuck up."

JAY:
Oh, really?

JOCELYN:
She thought it was really cool.

JAY:
Oh, nice.

JOCELYN:
Yeah, so the girl who sold me the body suit for the costume is, uh...

JAY:
Is a Plinkett fan?

JOCELYN:
She's a fan, yes.

JAY:
Oh, that's exciting.

JOCELYN:
So I thought that was kind of cool.

JACK:
Oh...
Oh...

JAY:
This is our hi-tech lighting rig.

JACK:
It looks like a tiny light on top of a tiny camera.

JAY:
I know what it looks like.

JACK:
I'm just letting you know.
That's powerful.

JAY:
Yeah.

JACK:
That's...

JAY:
Yeah, this, this little light's amazing.

JACK:
Yeah.
That's, actually...

JOCELYN:
It's pretty badass, isn't it?

JACK:
Really frightening.
Um, how did you get into character?
To, to stand there?

JAY:
"To stand there."

JOCELYN:
Um, well, I did put on my lipstick.

JACK:
Uh-huh.
Looks good.

JOCELYN:
And, um, that only helps me because my face is not in the shot.

JAY:
Not in this shot.

JOCELYN:
So that really, really makes a difference for, for how I, how I got myself into the moment for this character, for this moment.

MIKE:
Wind test.

JAY:
Nice.

JACK:
Okay.
Another wind test.
You guys can't see that.
It's Mike flapping a cardboard piece of box.
Well, that looks great!

JAY:
Why do big Hollywood films waste so much money on those giant, like, fans?

MIKE:
All they need is this.

JAY:
All you need is a piece of cardboard.
Hollywood is fucked up.
We don't have our priorities straight.

JACK:
So we are here...
Jay, where are we right now?

JAY:
Uh, we are at Bucketworks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
That's where we are shooting this sequence.
And, uh, it's, what would you call this place?
It's where other artists can, can come here and work on their projects, right?

JACK:
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

JAY:
And what is being worked on right now as we're shooting is, uh, puppets for Night of the Living Dead: The Puppet Show.
I'm very excited about this.
So, uh, I don't wanna mess up their puppets, but...
Look at these puppets.
Night of the Living Dead: The Puppet Show.

MIKE:
Does that camera take good pictures in low light?
It's okay if you touch it.

JAY:
I think his top comes off, and you see his brain.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JACK:
Oh, that's cool.

JAY:
That's pretty cool.

MIKE:
It's kind of scary.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Looks like a burn victim.

JAY:
We're giving a plug for these people, even though we don't know them at all.

JACK:
We just love...

JAY:
I, I endorse their endeavor.

JACK:
So you've never met these people?

JAY:
I don't know who these people are.
But I'm, I'm gonna go to it.
Yeah.

JOCELYN:
Basic.
A smooth, rich taste.
These are, like, the shittiest cigarettes ever.

JACK:
Basic's.
Preferred by prostitutes everywhere.
That is, that is just a sparkler attached to a machete.

MIKE:
Now we're going to attempt this as, as, as an intitial idea.
Uh, a tape here.
And a burned down...

JACK:
That's the Hollywood effect.

MIKE:
That's how, that's how they do it.

JACK:
For sparking the sword against the wall.

JAY:
That's how big movies do it, right?

MIKE:
It's a five-cent effect.

JACK:
What are, what, what, give me some predictions on, on the likelihood of this working.

JAY:
Um, well, as we always say whenever we attempt some sort of special effect,
"There's not many ways that this can go right."

MIKE:
So, just, um...

JACK:
That's a great shot.

JAY:
Well, the great thing about it is, um, you see the wall on the left side, and then on the right side, you see the machete.

JACK:
Oh!

JAY:
So, it's, it's always good to, to shoot, um...

JACK:
What you want people to see.

JAY:
What you want people to see.
Are we ready?

MIKE:
Yep.
I'm set.
I'm not in the shot, right?

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
I'm just gonna do this and step back.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Shadow's not showing or anything?

JAY:
Nope.

MIKE:
All right, you rolling?

JAY:
I'm rolling.
We'll see what happens.

JOCELYN:
You have to hold it for a while.
There you go.

JAY:
Wait, wait!

JACK:
Is it still going?

MIKE:
Go!

JAY:
Wait!
Okay.
Go.

JACK:
That didn't look bad.

JAY:
No, I think it might work.

JACK:
That actually looked kind of good.
That's, uh...

MIKE:
Hopefully, it'll look cooler in slo-mo.

JACK:
Everything looks cooler in slo-mo.

JAY:
I'm not good with continuity.

JACK:
Jay's like,
"I've never seen the reviews."

JAY:
I've never watched any of them.
Why would I?
Why would anyone, really?

JACK:
I mean, you, you shoot all this stuff...

JAY:
I'll help shoot the live-action stuff, just because it's the only time I get out of the house, but I'm not gonna watch this crap.

MIKE:
We're almost ready.
We're ready.

JOCELYN:
Oh!
Ugh!
Mmm!
Ugh!

MIKE:
Okay.
Um, do you have kind of, uh, uh, I would say we just go through the whole process.

JOCELYN:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And just, just grab, start grabbing shots.

JAY:
This has it in there.

JACK:
Yeah, this is just you two.

WILLY WONKA:
"Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination."

JOCELYN:
"Take a look and you'll see into your imagination."

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
Smoke.
It smells a bit like cooked turkey.

JAY:
Yeah.
It's chicken.
But, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, I was just about to do this.

JAY:
Mike, what are we shooting here?

MIKE:
We're filming Mr. Plinkett scenes for live-action sequences for the Mr., Episode III review.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Or, Mr. Plinkett's going, he's going to be mailing pizza rolls out again.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
But we're setting up some of the plotline.
But, um, we're, uh, dismembering the, the advertisements.
He does creepy things like this.
Like a psychopath would.
"6-6-6."
"Execute Order 666."

JAY:
So here's our "cooked cat", which we accidentally just cooked for real.

MIKE:
It stinks.

JAY:
It smells smokey, and it stinks in here.
Because we wanted to cook the pizza rolls, so I pre-heated the oven, and forgot I had this thing set inside there, so the cats wouldn't get it.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Ironically, we put the cooked cat inside the oven so that the real cats didn't eat the fake cooked cat that the real cats were supposed to be...the fake cooked cat.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
It's a cyclical, uh, it's what they call, um, uh...

JAY:
A fuckup.

MIKE:
No, no, no.
It's, uh, it's what they call a, um, um...
Shit.
What is the term?
A para-...
A parallax?
A paradigm?

JAY:
Paradox?

MIKE:
A paradox!
Um, a cyclical paradox.
Ugh.
We put the fake cooked cat in the oven...
I shouldn't be eating it.
So we put the fake cooked cat in the oven to hide it from the real cats so they don't eat the fake cooked cat.
Then the real cats were the ones that Mr. Plinkett cooked in his oven in the video.
So it...
Fuck it.
It's conf-, it's too confusing.
So we're attempting...
You ruined it.

JAY:
Sorry.

MIKE:
So we're attempting to, to age Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace by putting it in the oven.
Here we go.

JAY:
There's not many ways this can go right.

MIKE:
Hopefully, we don't burn the place down.

JAY:
Yeah.
We just cooked some pizza rolls
So we're gonna shoot a scene, and we're most likely gonna forget that the VHS tape is in the oven.

MIKE:
And this is the footage the police find.
Wait.
And so this is the footage the fire investigator finds.
Cause of apartment complex burn, burning?
Two idiots.

JAY:
Episode I.
See, Episode I just ruins everything.

MIKE:
It really does.
It's going to ruin a whole lot of people's lives.
Ooh.
Heaven's Gate.

JAY:
How's it going?
That didn't take long.
This was in, it was in there for what, like, two minutes?

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it was probably way too hot.

JAY:
And the case isn't affected at all.

MIKE:
It's a litte...

JAY:
Is it...

MIKE:
Yellowed.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
It's darker, actually.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's hot.
Yeah.

JAY:
Put a hole right in the middle of it there.
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's neat.

JAY:
Well, now we know what happens when you stick a VHS tape in the oven.

MIKE:
So this is the Episode I: The Phantom Menace VHS tape that's been cooked in the oven.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Um...

JAY:
This isn't what we had originally planned.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
We didn't mean to burn it, but we're improvising here.

MIKE:
Yeah.
We're improvising.
So Mr. Plinkett's gonna piss on it in the toilet.
Um, but we're pouring New Glarus Spotted Cow...
Not that Spotted Cow is piss.
It's a great Milwaukee brew.
Wisconsin brew.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Um, but, uh, it, it's a good simulation of urine.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
So we're not really pissing on the tape, just so you know.
Although we really should.
I'm sure someone has, somewhere.
Okay, now we're cleaning the VHS tape.
What am I doing with my life?

JAY:
We have a toilet full of beer.
And a melted VHS tape.

MIKE:
So, yeah, it was just, uh, it's nice and clean.
Safe.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Safe that it won't, uh, it won't, uh, give you any kind of weird disease, or anything.
Perhaps I'll even...
No, I, I won't wash it with soap.
Just some nice water.
And we'll dry it out.
Um, in fact, you can even try and play it in your VCR.

JOCELYN:
What the fuck?

JAY:
Yeah.

JOCELYN:
Okay.
Um...
You got his Star Wars toys.
All those bones.
And his Titanic popcorn tub.

JAY:
That last part.

JOCELYN:
You got his Star Wars toys.
He's got some bones.
And his favorite popcorn Titanic...
His...
I don't know why I wanna say "favorite".

JAY:
I don't know.

JOCELYN:
Um...
He's got...
Oh.
He's got his Star Wars toys.
You got some bones.
And his Titanic popcorn tub.

JAY:
Okay.
That's good.

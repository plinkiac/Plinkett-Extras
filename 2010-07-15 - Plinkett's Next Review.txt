PALPATINE:
Lord Plinkett, what is your next review?

PLINKETT:
Twilight.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
Twilight.

PALPATINE:
The one that's out now now?

PLINKETT:
No, the first one.

PALPATINE:
No.
I have foreseen your next review.
It is unavoidable.
It is your destiny.

PLINKETT:
Cop Dog?

PALPATINE:
What?
I can feel your anger.

PLINKETT:
Look, would you just get out of my bathroom?

PALPATINE:
I sense great fear in you.

PLINKETT:
That's not fear you sense in me.
That's taco salad.

PALPATINE:
Now...make the review.

PLINKETT:
No.

PLINKETT:
Do it!

PALPATINE:
Stop it!

PLINKETT:
Do it!

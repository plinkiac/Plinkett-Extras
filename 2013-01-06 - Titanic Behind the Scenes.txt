MIKE:
Oh.
Uh, yeah.

JAY:
On camera, it'll be more pur-, like, it'll be dark so that lines will stick out more, and might look...

MIKE:
Well, the, the wizard is the funnier...
We are preparing for our failure with, um, with our gigantic Titanic snow globe.
We couldn't find a real Titanic snow globe, um...
So we had to fabricate one.
And this was the smallest Titanic model I could find.
The likelihood of this working is, is nil.

PLINKETT:
Oh, fuck!

MIKE:
But we're gonna glue the base on, and then flip it over and hopefully it's watertight.

JAY:
Wh-, what, do you think the chances are of this working?

GIRL:
Well, I believe in everything, so I think it's going to work perfectly.

JAY:
All right.
Some optimism.
What do you think the chances are this working?

JESSI:
I'm really scared.

MIKE:
Maybe a little higher than 1%.

JESSI:
Maybe 1 & 1/2.

JAY:
Yeah.
It looks good.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
The water makes it larger-looking.

JESSI:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay, here we go.
And...

JAY:
All right.
That's good on smoke.
And...action.

MIKE:
Here's my Titanic snow globe.
Isn't it big?
Let me go have the Navi take a picture with it.

GIRL:
Like that?

JAY:
Yeah.
We're gonna blow up the Titanic.
We're gonna reveal what really happened.

MIKE:
What really happened?
Uh, oh, a spacecraft came down and shot the ship in half.

MIKE:
So, we've rigged, uh, we've rigged this part up.
We split it and rigged it with explosives, little bombs, and a bunch of debris.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
So we're gonna dip it in the water with this base.
Uh, hopefully prop it up.
And then shoot it in slow motion, and hopefully it breaks properly.

JAY:
Hopefully it breaks properly.
Or at least explodes in a way that looks cool.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
We'll see.
Shit.
You've gotta be kidding me!

MIKE:
It was a dud.

JAY:
So, ironically enough, we can't get the Titanic to sink.

MIKE:
Yeah!
Yeah!

JAY:
Whoo!

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Fucking finally!

MIKE:
It sunk slowly, too!

JAY:
Oh, good!

MIKE:
Are you ready for Christmas, Jay?
I am, too.
And it's great to know that Red Letter Media has an assortment of new items for sale.
Just in time for the holiday season.
Items like sticker.
Half in the Bag pint glasses.
DVD's.
Posters.
And button.

JAY:
When is the next Plinkett review?

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
And they even offer super value pack.
Which is all the aforementioned items sold together.
What a value.

JAY:
Kill me.

PLINKETT:
Enough of the sellout crap.
When's the next Plinkett review?
Oh, wait.
I'm me.
Anyway, my new review is in the progress.
It'll probably be done in a week or two.
Maybe even sooner.
But don't hold me to that.
Because sometimes I like to take a break.
And go shuttlecocking.
But anyway, my next review is for a movie you've all been requesting, and can't wait to see a review on.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?
I'm sorry.
Back to the other ads.
So many ads.
When did Jay and Mike sell out and jump the shark?

MIKE:
Where are you going, Jay?
Off to get these great items?

JAY:
I'm going to kill myself.

MIKE:
But Jay, you're eating Chunky's Chicken.
Isn't that already a slow form of suicide?

JAY:
Yay!

RICH:
Merry Christmas, guys!
It's me, Rich Evans!

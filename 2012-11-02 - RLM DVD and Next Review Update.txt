PLINKETT:

Stop by our store page and order it up.

RON LIPSKI:
Ahhhhh!

TITANIA:
Lahhhh!

PLINKETT:
And more rich Evans than you ever want to see!

RICH:
Oh...

PLINKETT:
Oh, my god!
Also we are Feeding Frenzy in stock, too.
If you buy both DVD's, you get a free button.
It's a small little button.
We also have posters in stock.
This one's a Star Wars-themed poster.
It's very topical now, since Lucasfilm just bought Disney.
Fuck, is that supposed to be me?
Also, for those of you that are already typing, "When's the next Plinkett review," I'm happy to announce that I'm editing it right now.
That's right.
it'll probably be done pretty soon.
Maybe.
But to tide you over until it's released, here's an exclusive clip.
"Sinatra, you fuck!"
Wasn't that great?
Don't you want to see it now?
I bet you wish you knew what movie it was about.
Don't forget to head over to our store page and buy things.
I need the money.
I got so many bills, they're gonna to have to start calling them Peters.
Or Williams.
Shit.

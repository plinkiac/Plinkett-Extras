PALPATINE:
Arise, Lord Plinkett.
The time has come.
 
PLINKETT:
Hey, nobody asked you.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
Quiet your facehole.

PALPATINE:
I have foreseen this day for a long, long time.

PLINKETT:
Yeah, my new review is done.
It's Star Trek.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
I just finished it yesterday.

PALPATINE:
What?

PLINKETT:
It's up on my webzone, redlettermedia.com.

PALPATINE:
You have failed me for the last time.

PLINKETT:
Look, I'll review Episode III next, I guess.
Probably.
I just needed a break from Star Wars.

PALPATINE:
What in the fuck is Star Wars?

PLINKETT:
Huh?

PALPATINE:
Your destiny was to review Mobile Suit Gundam Crossfire, and how it totally ruined Kidou Senshi Ze Gundam: Hot Scramble.
It was total bullshit that they would even release a game like that for PlayStation.

PLINKETT:
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you at the mall?

PALPATINE:
I had to pick up a few things.
Look, I have this list.
Next, you will need to review Metal Gear 3.
Then after that, you should review Dragonball Z: Bardock, The Father of Goku.

PLINKETT:
Hey.
Hey, stop.

PALPATINE:
And lastly, you should review the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King expansion pack...

PLINKETT:
Hey, quiet.

PALPATINE:
...and how it totally ruined the first expansion pack...

PLINKETT:
Hey, quiet.

PALPATINE:
...called Burning Crusade.
And that basically ruined World of Warcraft.

PLINKETT:
Hey, stop.
Do you have an erection?

PALPATINE:
Yes!

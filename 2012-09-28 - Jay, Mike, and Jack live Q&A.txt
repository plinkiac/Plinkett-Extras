PLINKETT:
Hey, everyone.
This Saturday October 6 the Milwaukee Film Festival presents three assholes talk about web videos.
Yeah.
That's actually the name of it.
It's a panel hosted by Jay Bauman, Mike Stokl-, Stoklasa, and Jack Packard!
Jack is from a site called Funny or Die.
He made internet hits such as:
The High Five videos...

TIM HIGGINS:
Hey, pass me a beer!

PLINKETT:
HHey Pass Me a Beer.
And...Cock Gun.
He's also the co-creator and the guy inside the Fuck-Bot costume.

FUCK-BOT 5000:
I want to fuck more!
I want to fuck more!
You like it like that?
You like it like that?

PLINKETT:
You little...Fuck-Bot!
Also in attendance will be actress Jocelyn Ridgely, and internet legend Rich Evans in his first public appearance ever.
And I mean ever.
Because he never leaves his house.
So come out to this pointless event.
Ask Jay and Mike questions like:
"When is the next Plinkett review?"
And:
"When is the next Plinkett review?"
The event starts at 7 p.m. at Y-Not III Tavern 1854 East Kenilworth Place, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
If you're nowhere near Milwaukee, please post a comment below telling us that.
Then we could move the event closer to you.
We'll be hanging out after the Q&A, so it's the perfect time for you to buy Rich Evans a beer.
He likes these brands.
He also loves to do shots.

PALPATINE:
I approve of these things.

PLINKETT:
Wait a minute, what?
Aren't you supposed to complain?

PALPATINE:
I approve of these things because, like you, I have also sold out!

PLINKETT:
Hey, they aren't getting paid for this.
Plus, it's free.

PALPATINE:
When is the next get review?

PLINKETT:
Remember, this is a free event, so you don't have to wait in line like these people to pay for tickets.

PLINKETT:
This mic on?
Hello?
Hello?
I made a new review.
I just finished it.
It's up on my webzone, redlettermedia.com.
Everybody see my review, and then post a comment on the video as well.
Eventually, I'll upload it here if you wanna wait.
But, I dunno.
It's gonna be a while, idiot.
A lot of people say my new review sucks.
You know what I think sucks?
The people that said that.
I gotta go.
My cat called the spousal abuse hotline again.
My cat keeps telling it that I beat it.
It's not true.
It's a fucking lie.
My cat fell down the stairs.

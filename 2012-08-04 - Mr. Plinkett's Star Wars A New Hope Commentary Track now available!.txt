PLINKETT:
Hey, everyone.
It's me, Mr.
Plinkett, and I'm here to tell you that I've got a new commentary track available right now.
That's right.
It's for Star Wars: Episode VI, A New Hope.
Watch the movie and listen along as I complain about the adventures of our favorite space heroes.
Luke Starkiller.
Han Soloman.
Princess Handjob.
Chupacabra.
And who can forget the lovable C-3PO and R2-D2?
You can get the track right now on our site, redlettermedia.com.
Remember to hit play the second you see the trademark Star Wars logo on your TV screen.
Then sit back and enjoy a half a dozen of your favorite beverages.
Or perhaps a smoke huge fucking bong and laugh a guaranteed three to five times during the two-hour long running time.

DISCLAIMER:
Laughs not guaranteed.

PLINKETT:
Now, for those of you who are already complaining that this is not another video review.
Well, hold tight.
I'm working on one right now.
In fact, I might be working on two at the same time!
Hey, I didn't punch my way out of a fucking coffin for nothing.

DISCLAIMER:
Commentary not guaranteed to be funny or interesting.

PLINKETT:
I'll see you all in hell!

PLINKETT:
Hello.
I'm back with my new review.
It took me six months to make it, but it's finally done.
It's for a movie called Cop Dog.
This is a film that fans of movies have been debating about for years, and I'm finally going to put the debate to rest.
For a link to what my next review will be, please click on the box as you see it inside of the video monitor.
No, no, don't, don't click there.
I mean, click over here.
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
Are you drunk?
Click on this box over here.
You didn't click it hard enough.
Now click over...you fuck up.
Also, we just finished a Red Letter Media app for your iPhone or other mobile devices.
Except for if you have an Android.
I think somebody's working on that.
I don't even know.
But if you wanna download my app, go to my webzone and click on the link.
Or search for fucking whatever in the app land.
I don't even know how, what the hell I'm talking about.

PALAPTINE:
Quit hocking your cheap wares, Plinkett!

PLINKETT:
Who's that?

PALAPTINE:
I have returned from the netherworld of the Force!

PLINKETT:
Bea Arthur?

PALAPTINE:
Yes, it is I...

PLINKETT:
Oh, you sound like somebody else that used to talk to me in these videos.

PALAPTINE:
Rue McClenahan?

PLINKETT:
Look, Bea, we love you, baby, but can you go back to the netherworld of the Force?

PALAPTINE:
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you Fuck you!

PLINKETT:
Can you take any longer to return to the Netherworld of the Force

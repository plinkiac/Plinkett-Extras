PALPATINE:
I have felt a great disturbance in the Force.
An awakening, you might say.
JJ Abrams and Disney have remade Star Wars and called it a sequel.
An act so evil, even I wouldn't have thought of it!
Such manipulation and trickery can mean only one thing: the Dark Side.

PLINKETT:
Oh, my god.
What's wrong with your face?

PALPATINE:
Some are saying that George Lucas is a secret genius with their Star Wars "ring theory".
Eww.
Idiotic millennials are rethinking the Star Wars prequels.
And yet still others petitioned for George Lucas to return to direct Star Wars: Episode IX.
They say the internet bullied him away from Star Wars.
Boo-hoo.
It is time to arise, Lord Plinkett!
Terrible forces are at work.

PLINKETT:
Oh, my god!
It feels like I've been asleep for years!
Jesus Christ, it stinks in here!
Oh, my goodness.
I really have been asleep for years.
I grew a giant beard.
I guess that makes me kind of like Gandalf.
Except for I don't have any magical powers.
And I don't fuck men.
I've gotta piss!
Number 1.
Oh, fuck!

PALPATINE:
These are dark times

PLINKETT:
Ugh!
Oh, fuck!

PALPATINE:
Only one man can help Star Wars get back on course.

PLINKETT:
Jesus Christ!
My god, talk about an upper decker.

PALPATINE:
You have much work to do.

PLINKETT:
Ugh.
Well, time to flush the toilet like a good boy.
Wow, that was a good pee.
What, what the fuck?
What is this?
Somebody take this to my bathroom wall!
What the fuck?
Star Wars: The Force Awakens?
What is this, a fan film?
No, wait a minute.
This is real!
I'd recognize Chewbacca anywhere!
Oh, wait a minute.
There's Chewbacca.
Oh, my god!
What the fuck?
Star Wars is back?
What is this?
Who are these people?
What is that?
Is that a robot?
What is that?
R2-D2 got a beer belly?

PALPATINE:
Good...

PLINKETT:
Wait a minute!
This is an outrage!
This is a fucking outrage!

PALPATINE:
I can feel your anger.

PLINKETT:
I don't know what to do with myself!

PALPATINE:
It makes you strong.
Gives you purpose!

PLINKETT:
I haven't even seen the fucking movie yet, and I hate it!
Star Wars!
What the fuck?
"Awakens"?
